# Lesson Learning Objectives

## 1. Identify variables as numerical and categorical

Numerical (Quantitative) variables: numerical values, which are sensible to add, subtract, take averages, etc., with these values

Categorical (Qualitative) variables: take a unlimited number of distinct categories, these categories can be identified with numbers for example, it is customary to see the gender of variable coded as zero for males and one for females. But it wouldn't be sensible to do arithmetic operations with these values.

## 2. Define associated variables as variables that show some relationship with one another. Further categorize this relationship as positive or negative association, when possible

## 3. Define variables that are not associated as independent.
